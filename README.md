A small mini project to test my skills in html and css.

A project that I worked on during my HTML, CSS, JS course so that I can practice my theoretical skills I learned in this course hands on with some practical implementation so that I can learn from my mistakes and get a good understanding of my practical skills.

This project gave me a good understanding of
  - How flexbox works?
  - How different component's style attributes works?
  - How to use classes and ids properly for full optimization of CSS?
  - Basic CSS attributes.
